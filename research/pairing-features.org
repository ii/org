#+TITLE: Possible Features for Pairing
* TODO Integrate w/ ReadOnly rendering of buffer

I saw something like this a while back.
We ran a web server attached directly to the buffer.
The web server was served from emacs directly.
Changes to the buffer immediatly showed up in the browser.
It included color syntax highlighting.

* TODO Startup X number of togetherly urls

When opening a document that has some list of names as a property or var.
When we run (start-hackmd-replacement).
It launches a togetherly client for each name.
Possibly embedding the name into the socket.
It might also start it in a container, to isolate it away from the main user's desktop.
